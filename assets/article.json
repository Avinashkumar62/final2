      "description":"Insomniac Games has just unveiled an electrifying update: Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the next chapter in the riveting Spider-Man saga, will hit PlayStation 5 on October 20, 2023. Following the footsteps of the highly praised predecessors—Marvel's Spider-Man (2018) and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020)—this newest addition is expected to set to expand the virtual New York we first saw in the previous game.Developed from the ground up for the Play Station 5, this sequel will harness the full power of the next-gen console."
